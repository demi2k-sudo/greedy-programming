# Greedy Algorithms Coding Challenges

This repository contains Python implementations of various coding challenges discussed in the YouTube video titled "Learn Greedy Algorithms | Greedy Algorithms Explained with Examples" by Tanishq Chaudhary. The video covers the concept of greedy algorithms and demonstrates their application through solving coding challenges.

## Video Overview

The video introduces greedy algorithms and explains the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage. It provides explanations and solutions for the following coding challenges:

- Bulbs
- Highest Product
- Disjoint Intervals
- Largest Permutation
- Meeting Rooms
- Distribute Candy
- Seats
- Assign Mice to Holes
- Gas Station

## Contents

The repository contains Python scripts for each of the coding challenges discussed in the video, except for the Majority Element challenge.

## Usage

Each Python script in this repository corresponds to a specific coding challenge. You can run the scripts individually to see the implementation and test them with different inputs.
